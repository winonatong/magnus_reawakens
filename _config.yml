people:

- name: '@xxseven'
  pic: xxseven
  position: xxse7en is a xenolinguist and has conducted extensive research in the Shaper glyphs and exogenous symbology. His ongoing pursuits have revealed much about asynchronous, transdimensional communications, and he has been instrumental in their interpretation. Also, as a wilderness explorer, his work has shed illumination on remnants of much undiscovered Shaper communication in remote, natural areas.

- name: '@StirlingClay'
  pic: StirlingClay
  position: StirlingClay brings his experience managing communications for a global health and well being organization to the team in order to facilitate enhanced, bi-directional communication through the portal network. With a specialization in working with expanding "group mind" collaboration, he trains willing participants to embrace MU fields for the benefit of all humanity.

- name: '@Jookwarrior'
  pic: Jookwarrior
  position: "Jookwarrior is an engineer who loves to tinker, play video games, eat great food, and explore new places. Because this description is actually not terribly descriptive, here are some relatively unknown non-opsec facts: He can play the cello/piano but hasn't done so in years...he can bend his left thumb backwards but not his right...he dislikes beans and taro with a passion...and though he's done the Inca Trail twice and the backside of Half Dome, he's not terribly fond of heights.'"

- name: '@GoblynSF'
  pic: GoblynSF
  position: Since goblins only have two viable career choices, GoblynSF did not want to be Level 1 dungeon fodder and instead currently works at Gringotts. GoblynSF also collects Exotic Matter and strings of prayer beads in his spare time, as well as <a href="http://www.goblynscomics.com">drawing comics</a>.

- name: '@UndiKiwi'
  pic: UndiKiwi
  position: Is a data specialist who actually loves everything about his job. He enjoys the outdoors, especially out sailing on the Bay. He admires Nature in all its Glory sometimes capturing it on film. And, of course, he enjoys chillin’ with Ingress. Oops… there he goes recharging another Portal :-)

- name: '@YoreGrace'
  pic: YoreGrace
  position: Agent YoreGrace leverages his native San Franciscan status to lend a local&#39;s perspective &amp; input to the TransVisionary Oracle and Magnus Reawakens happenings. A newcomer to XM Research, YoreGrace&#39;s lack in experience and technical expertise is offset by his enthusiasm, a positive perspective, and genuine &quot;can-do&quot; attitude.
